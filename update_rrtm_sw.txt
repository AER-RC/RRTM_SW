*** Update notice for Release RRTM_SW v2.6 ***

July 2005:

	Release_2_6

	Internal Release Only

	* Updated revision statements in RDI1MACH.f and extra.f.  Codes
	are compatible with rrtm_lw.

	* Modified delta-m scaling variables in rtrdis.f to account for
	cosine response option

	* Text output changes and PI value change to rrtm.f

	* Updated rrtatm.f to be compatible with lblatm.f CVS revision 9.3

	* Updated makefiles

Mid-April 2004:

	Release_2_5

		* Updated DISORT v1 to DISORT v2 to be compatible with 
		version of DISORT in the RRTM_LW code

		* Improved cloud properties routine to:

		a)include scattering properties of spheres, based on the 
		parameterization by Key et al. in the STREAMER RT code.  
	
		b) to output a file (OUT_CLD_RRTM) with the cloud scattering 
		properties by layer. 

		c) changed name of cldprop_sw.f to cldprop.f to be 
		consistent with RRTM_LW structure.

		* Updated atmospheric properties module RRTATM to be 
		compatible with the most recent version of LBLATM v8.1.
	
		* Fixed error in the last declared digits of "pi".
	
	 	* Removed unnecessary duplicate calculations which 
		occurred for option IOUT=98.

		* Added new solar variability option (ISOLVAR)

	 	* Changed number of significant digits in the net flux 
		output in OUTPUT_RRTM.  This was necessary for the 
		stratospheric adjustment routine required for the Boeing 
		project.
	
		* Changed format statement in subroutine readaer to allow
	        more than 4 aerosol layers (naer, format statement 9010).

        	* Updated instruction manual.

		* Modified makefiles to be double precision, as required 
		to keep robust results from DISORT.

		* Added patent statement to each module.
	 

		
October 25, 2002:

	Release_2_4_1 

		Bug repair in readaer subroutine in rrtm.f

		Update makefiles to be consistent with other AER makefiles

April, 2002

	Release_2_4 - Addition of Q. Fu ice particle parameterization

	To incorporate this parameterization required the explicit
	calculation outside of disort of the delta-m scaling
	method for all species (cloud, aerosol, gases).


October 11, 2001

	Release_2_3 - Cosine response, Delta-M method

	Incorporated ability to calculate fluxes using a instrumental
	cosine response.  
	Incorporated ability to output either delta-m or true fluxes.
	
	Repaired all revision numbers and output so OUTPUT_RRTM file
	will have CVS revision numbers.
