March 2014

	Release 2_7_2
      
        Internal Release (also sent to Netsanet)

        rrtm.f: modified one line to allow comppiling with gfortran

        makefiles: now linked to util_xxx.f90
                   added makefile for gfortran

        Note: to get good executables need to compile and run on anvil. pgf90
	 code runs all test cases successfully, gfortran crashes on tropical ice cloud
	 case

March 2010:

      Release_2_7_1

      Internal Release Only

      * rrtm.f: Add two more digits to the read statement for the SOLVAR variable (statement 9020)

July 2006:

	Release_2_7

	Internal Release Only

	* Modified READAER routine in rrtm.f: Wavelength for calculation of aerosol optical depth
	in each band is now fixed, rather than calculated for each run.  The fixed wavelength was 
	determined from comparisons with CHARTS runs.  This wavelength is slightly modified 
	according to the opacity of the aerosol layer.

	* Updated the water vapor continuum to be consistent with MT_CKD.  
	lblrtm_v9.4_f90_pgi_linux_sgl (mt_ckd_1.2), linefile aer_v_1.0 and lnfl_v2.1 were used 
	for this update.

	* Modified Band 28 in taumoldis.f to set the optical depth to "TAURAY" only when the
	gaseous optical depth contribution is negative.  This will happen for extreme (cold)
	atmospheres.

	* Increased maximum number of computational layers allowed by disort.f

July 2005:

	Release_2_6

	Internal Release Only

	* Updated revision statements in RDI1MACH.f and extra.f.  Codes
	are compatible with rrtm_lw.

	* Modified delta-m scaling variables in rtrdis.f to account for
	cosine response option

	* Text output changes and PI value change to rrtm.f

	* Updated rrtatm.f to be compatible with lblatm.f CVS revision 9.3

	* Updated makefiles

Mid-April 2004:

	Release_2_5

		* Updated DISORT v1 to DISORT v2 to be compatible with 
		version of DISORT in the RRTM_LW code

		* Improved cloud properties routine to:

		a)include scattering properties of spheres, based on the 
		parameterization by Key et al. in the STREAMER RT code.  
	
		b) to output a file (OUT_CLD_RRTM) with the cloud scattering 
		properties by layer. 

		c) changed name of cldprop_sw.f to cldprop.f to be 
		consistent with RRTM_LW structure.

		* Updated atmospheric properties module RRTATM to be 
		compatible with the most recent version of LBLATM v8.1.
	
		* Fixed error in the last declared digits of "pi".
	
	 	* Removed unnecessary duplicate calculations which 
		occurred for option IOUT=98.

		* Added new solar variability option (ISOLVAR)

	 	* Changed number of significant digits in the net flux 
		output in OUTPUT_RRTM.  This was necessary for the 
		stratospheric adjustment routine required for the Boeing 
		project.
	
		* Changed format statement in subroutine readaer to allow
	        more than 4 aerosol layers (naer, format statement 9010).

        	* Updated instruction manual.

		* Modified makefiles to be double precision, as required 
		to keep robust results from DISORT.

		* Added patent statement to each module.
	 

		
October 25, 2002:

	Release_2_4_1 

		Bug repair in readaer subroutine in rrtm.f

		Update makefiles to be consistent with other AER makefiles

April, 2002

	Release_2_4 - Addition of Q. Fu ice particle parameterization

	To incorporate this parameterization required the explicit
	calculation outside of disort of the delta-m scaling
	method for all species (cloud, aerosol, gases).


October 11, 2001

	Release_2_3 - Cosine response, Delta-M method

	Incorporated ability to calculate fluxes using a instrumental
	cosine response.  
	Incorporated ability to output either delta-m or true fluxes.
	
	Repaired all revision numbers and output so OUTPUT_RRTM file
	will have CVS revision numbers.

September 21, 2001:
